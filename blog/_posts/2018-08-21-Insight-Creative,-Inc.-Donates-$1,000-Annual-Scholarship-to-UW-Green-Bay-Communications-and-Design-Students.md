To mark their 30th anniversary, Insight Creative donated funds to open the “Insight Creative, Inc.

The $1,000 scholarship will be available next spring for communications and design students at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay (the place where Insight Creative founders Jim and Monica von Hoff met). The $1,000 scholarship will be available annually.
