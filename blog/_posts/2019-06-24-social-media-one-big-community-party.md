A common marketing goal for small businesses is to grow and engage with followers on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. You know how to accomplish this goal; you hear about it all the time: _Share the right content at the right place at the right time_.

Providing the right content to your target audience at the right place and time sounds pretty straightforward … well, it’s easier said than done.

You may know HOW to grow and engage with your followers, but you aren’t sure with WHAT. You know HOW to get to your destination, but you aren’t sure WHAT mode of transportation you need to use.

Here are four ‘go-to’ social media content strategies to get you on the right track:

**1.	Share User-Generated Content**

If your target audience is primarily consumers, user-generated content is a great place to start. Let’s say you’re a local fashion boutique who also promotes beauty products. Your customers share photos of their new blush-colored sweater or a unique lipstick shade that they’re wearing.

Reposting this content on your social media platforms will encourage others to share—or visit your boutique—plus friends and family who see this on their newsfeeds will be more likely to engage. An added bonus, you don’t have to create this content from scratch!

**2.	Post Photos and Videos**

Myth: You need fancy camera equipment to create high-quality content.

People like to see authentic content from business pages. Obviously, you don’t want to post blurry or confusing photos. But if they look too much like stock imagery, people will simply keep scrolling. There are endless FREE apps that can help you easily make photos and videos look professional while still remaining authentic to your business. Some recommendations are <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canva-graphic-design-photo-editing/id897446215" target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">Canva</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boomerang-from-instagram/id1041596399" target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">Boomerang</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917" target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hyperlapse</a>.

**3.	Highlight Your Employees**

Visual proof that there are real, human beings running your business will provide comfort to your customers. Whether it’s an “employee spotlight” post or sharing photos of employees at a networking event, _people_ connect with other _people_.

Also, encourage employees to share content from your business page on their social media platforms. For example, if you allow your employees to bring their pets to work, ask them to snap a photo of their furry friend and post it on social media!

**4.	Provide Solutions to Pain Points**

If your target audience is primarily other businesses, providing solutions to their pain points is key. Once you understand a problem your audience is facing, share the solutions. Remember… don’t use this opportunity to sell yourself! The goal is to educate your audience by providing valuable tips and advice, not to promote your business. Be a trusted resource for your audience!
