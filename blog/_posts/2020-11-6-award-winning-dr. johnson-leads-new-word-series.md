Award-winning author and literacy scholar Dr. Bonnie Johnson will be lending her expertise in a new collaboration with Insight Creative, Inc. In an effort to deliver _**communication with substance**_, Insight will work with Dr. Johnson on an upcoming social media series called “Word Insights” that presents word origin and figurative expressions in a new and creative way. The series, launching later this month on Insight’s social media platforms, will show the true depth—and fun—of the language we use to communicate every day, whether socially in conversation, at a business meeting or in mass communications.
